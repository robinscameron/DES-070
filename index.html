			This course focuses on techniques of designing for the web. We will utilize problem solving as a way of creating design and content that serves in both form and function in order to develop web based projects. Students will have readings and discussions as well as learn basic practical knowledge about how digital design functions. We will look at topics concerning the history of coding and the internet, and related contemporary digital theory. In practical terms the course will teach students the basics of HTML + CSS, setting up a URL, user journeys and basic UX, asset creation, wireframing and responsive systems. The final project will be a multi-page website in HTML based on content that the student will create.

		<h1>
		  Readings
		  </h1>
		Every second week there will be readings that will expand on the ideas discussed in the course. The readings are design writings taken from many vantage points and from varying moments of design and art history. These readings will broaden your scope and allow you to be open minded about concepts that you may be able to utilize in your own work. We will have a brief discussion as a class each week about what we have read.
		<br><br>
		  
		<h1>
		  Presentations
		  </h1>
		  Each week one student will be selected to give a breif presentation of a website that they have found that inspires them, the student will walk the class through details that they notice about the website in a detailed session. I’ll start us off with one so we know what to expect. There will be a sign-up sheet available 
		  <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rob0Jx1K-mYxoBBCxf0eArKxSx6qYOBqvaIzmptXxpE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> and inspiration links <a href="https://www.are.na/robin-cameron/presentation-source-links">here</a>. 
		
		  <br><br>
		<h1>
		 Are.na sketchbook 
		  </h1>
		In order to keep your ideas organized we will utilize the website Are.na. This will be a sort of ‘digital sketchbook’ for what you come across in your research. As part of your grade you will be expected to have an Are.na channel with at least 20 blocks of inspiration / images / digital content that you’ve been gathering for the course and your projects, there is a chrome extension that might come in handy. You can also take notes directly in Are.na if you like. At the end of the course there will be an option to print a PDF or a book of your findings
		
		  <br><br>
		  <h1>
		    Inclusive Learning Statement
		  </h1>
		
		Your success in this class is important to me. We will all need accommodations because we all learn differently. If there are aspects of this course that prevent you from learning or exclude you, please let me know as soon as possible. Together we’ll develop strategies to meet both your needs and the requirements of the course. I encourage you to visit the Academic Development & Support Center to determine how you could improve your learning as well. If you need official accommodations, you have a right to have these met. 
		
		  <br><br>
		  <h1>
		    Attendance Policy
		  </h1>
		
		For virtual meetings, class attendance is mandatory. Circumstances beyond your control will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. It is your responsibility to catch up with class announcements, assignments, and materials on Blackboard. You may not receive credit for a course in which you fail to be present 80% of the time, as determined by the Attendance records. Students should not disrupt class by conducting any activities that interrupt.
		
		
		<br><br>
		  <h1>
		    Course Usage of Blackboard Learn
		  </h1>
		
		Copies of the course syllabus may be found on Blackboard Learn.  You are responsible for regularly checking the online resources, which is accessed through the Georgian Court Blackboard Site.  Additional support is found on the GCU Blackboard landing page.

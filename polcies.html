		<h2>
		  Nondiscrimination

		<br>
		It is policy of Georgian Court University to maintain an academic environment free of discrimination, including harassment, regardless of gender, race, creed, color, religion, age, national and ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, or veteran status. The University is committed to creating an environment which is free from intolerance directed toward individuals or groups. For details, see the current GCU undergraduate catalog. All inquiries shall be addressed in the Office of Human Resources.

		<h2>
		  Disabilities Services
		</h2>
		
		<br>
		Georgian Court University is committed to ensuring that all students receive equal access to all services, programs, and activities. We support students with documented physical, sensory, learning, or psychological disabilities by providing reasonable and appropriate accommodations in accordance with applicable laws, such as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. To request accommodations and/or academic adjustments, please contact the Academic Development and Support Center on the lower level of the Sister Mary Joseph Cunningham Library. Call 732-987-2363 or send an email to <a href="mailto:lfarh@georgian.edu">lfarh@georgian.edu</a> For more information, see <a href=" http://georgian.edu/academics/adsc/#disabilities-services">Disability Services</a>

		<h2>
		  Academic Integrity
		</h2>
		
		
		<br>
		Georgian Court strives to be a moral community with ethical convictions. Academic integrity is essential to collegial pursuit of truth and knowledge, and academic dishonesty is a serious offense which may result in failure for the course and even dismissal from Georgian Court. Anyone who willfully assists another in the breach of integrity is held equally responsible and subject to the same penalty. According to GCU policy, academic dishonesty is any act of cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, abuse of resources, forgery of academic documents, dissimulation, or sabotage, and any act of aiding and abetting academic dishonesty. One aspect of academic honesty that often surprises students is the expectation that you hand in original work that was not already handed in for a different course. Unless you have specifically obtained your instructor’s permission to hand in previously-completed work, this is a breach of academic honesty. See the catalog or student handbook for additional information. Check with your instructor BEFORE an assignment’s due date if you have questions about this policy.

		<h2>
		  Early Warning System – Intervention Tool
		</h2>
		<br>
		
		Georgian Court University has an electronic intervention tool called the Early Warning System. This tool will be invoked when a student is doing poorly in a course by demonstration of sub-par academic performance, attendance, or disposition.  Once an alert is activated in the Early Warning System, you will be notified and a Georgian Court University professional will reach out to you to discuss ways to help you succeed in this course.  This process is only meant to help you.
		 <br><br>
		<h2>
		  Withdrawal from this Course
		</h2>
		 <br>
		GCU policy permits undergraduate students to withdraw up to the 10th week (or equivalent for courses of shorter duration) and receive a “W” grade. This requires a "Request for Grade of W" form and a fee. You cannot withdraw from this course by not attending or by telling your instructor of your desire to withdraw. It is your responsibility to complete the official forms and procedures. An academic advisor must sign the form. A student who has not officially withdrawn will receive a grade based on all work, whether completed or not, including work assigned after the student stopped attending. The registrar publishes a list of deadlines to request a grade of “W” at <a href= http://georgian.edu/academics/registrar/important-dates/.> IMPORTANT DATES </a>
		<br>
		<br>
		WITHDRAWING FROM A COURSE CAN NEGATIVELY AFFECT YOUR FINANCIAL AID AND ACADEMIC STANDING – 
		be sure to check with the Financial Aid Office and your advisor before dropping any course.

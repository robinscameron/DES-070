		  This course focuses on techniques of designing for the web. We will utilize problem solving as a way of creating design and content that serves in both form and function in order to develop web based projects. Students will have readings and discussions as well as learn basic practical knowledge about how digital design functions. We will look at topics concerning the history of coding and the internet, and related contemporary digital theory. In practical terms the course will teach students the basics of HTML + CSS, setting up a URL, user journeys and basic UX, asset creation, wireframing, web rings and responsive systems. The final project will be a multi-page website in HTML, developing for a startup company.

			<br><br>
			<p>Absences + Deadlines</p>
			Projects are expected to be completed on the due date. You should be prepared to present your work to the class and participate in the critique. No excuses. Assignments turned in late will drop half letter for each day it is late. 
			More than three unexcused absences will result in a full grade drop. Being late to class three times unexcused is considered an absence. A doctor&rsquo;s, deans note must accompany excused absences. It is your responsibility to find out what you missed for assignments if you are not present in class. Use your time wisely.

		<h1>University Statements</h1><br>
		
		<p>Academic Integrity </p>
		<br>
We, the Lehigh University Student Senate, as the standing representative body of all undergraduates, reaffirm the duty and obligation of students to meet and uphold the highest principles and values of personal, moral and ethical conduct. As partners in our educational community, both students and faculty share the responsibility for promoting and helping to ensure an environment of academic integrity. As such, each student is expected to complete all academic course work in accordance to the standards set forth by the faculty and in compliance with the University’s Code of Conduct.
<br>
<br><p>Course Statement on Academic Integrity</p>
The work you do in this course must be your own. This means that you must be aware when you are building on someone else&rsquo;s ideas—including  the ideas of your classmates, your professor, and the authors you read—and explicitly acknowledge that you are do so. If you ever have questions about drawing the line between others&rsquo; work and your own, ask me and I will give you clear guidance or you may visit Lehigh Library&rsquo;s &lsquo;Proper Use of Information&rsquo; page <a href="http://libraryguides.lehigh.edu/plagiarism">here </a> 
<br>
<br>
<br><p>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities </p>
If you have a disability for which you are or may be requesting accommodations, please contact both your instructor and the Office of Academic Support Services, Williams Hall, Suite 301 (610-758-4152) as early as possible in the semester.  You must have documentation from the Academic Support Services office before accommodations can be granted.
<br>
<br><p>The Principles of Our Equitable Community </p>

<br><p>Lehigh University endorses </p>
<a href=http://www.lehigh.edu/~inprv/initiatives/PrinciplesEquity_Sheet_v2_032212.pdf>The Principles of Our Equitable Community.</a> We expect each member of this class to acknowledge and practice these Principles. Respect for each other and for differing viewpoints is a vital component of the learning environment inside and outside the classroom.
<br>
<br><p>Lehigh University Policy on Harassment and Non-Discrimination</p>
Lehigh University upholds The Principles of Our Equitable Community and is committed to providing an educational, working, co-curricular, social, and living environment for all students, staff, faculty, trustees, contract workers, and visitors that is free from harassment and discrimination on the basis of age, color, disability, gender identity or expression, genetic information, marital or familial status, national or ethnic origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status.  Such harassment or discrimination is unacceptable behavior and will not be tolerated. The University strongly encourages (and, depending upon the circumstances, may require) students, faculty, staff or visitors who experience or witness harassment or discrimination, or have information about harassment or discrimination in University programs or activities, to immediately report such conduct. 
<br>
<br><p>Statement on Lab Fees</p>
Lab fees for this and other designated courses in the Department of Art, Architecture and Design are set at $100 per student. They provide funding for many of the consumable materials, supplies, and services provided for your use in the course. Most of these are purchased on your behalf at quantity discounts that would be unavailable if purchasing the materials individually. Depending on the class, lab fees may also provide for specialized design software accessible to you in the department&rsquo;s PC and Mac labs, and through remote use in the virtualization of those computer terminals. Those classes that utilize the university&rsquo;s Design Labs will have a portion of their fee directed to cover materials and other shop consumables such as blades, abrasives and adhesives. In courses that include site visits to off-campus locations, lab fees may also cover some or all the cost of group travel and transportation. 
In this course, the majority of the lab fee is budgeted for: materials and supplies including paper, adhesives; tools including rulers, blades, brushes, and applicators
The lab fee will provide the minimum required for the successful completion of the course. However, throughout the semester, you may also need to purchase additional materials and supplies on your own.  What you decide to purchase and how much you spend will vary depending on the design choices you make. Spending more money may not make for a better project, although sometimes a good idea requires an investment to see it through. More likely, it will require time and effort rather than money.  It is recommended that total additional out of pocket expenses for this course be kept between $50 and $75. 

<br>
<br><p>End-of-Semester Cleanup</p>
When classes are over for the semester, before you depart campus and before the end of examination period, you are individually responsible for cleaning out the desk or work area that was assigned to you, and any projects, materials, or waste that remain there.  This means completely clearing off your desk surface; cleaning out any drawers or storage that were assigned to you; disposing of waste in or around your desk; and taking home or disposing of all projects that you produced for the course.  Your work area should be completely empty and clean, the way that it looked on day one of the semester.  Your instructor will review your work area at the end of the semester to ensure you have completed doing this.
